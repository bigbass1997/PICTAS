### Description
The PICTAS is a device used to replay Tool-Assisted-Speedruns on real hardware. While currently being developed for the N64, it may be capable of use on other retro consoles too.

A PIC18LF47K42 microcontroller is used as the brain of this device. While an ARM-based MCU could have been used instead, I already had prior experience with the PIC architecture and instruction set.
